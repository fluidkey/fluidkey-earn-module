## Fluidkey Savings Module

The Fluidkey Savings Module is a Safe module that allows Fluidkey to automatically deposit funds into an ERC-4626 vault on behalf of the Safe. It is based on the [AutoSavings module](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/core-modules/blob/main/src/AutoSavings/AutoSavings.sol) authored by Rhinestone.

## Deployment

* Salt: `f10ed4ee` (production) and `de4e` (development) with padding before
* Create3 factory: `0x4088E5933b8260ff2D9CA5CED4Bb796482A660f0`
* Owner: `0x9E3eba321427941868cB4123De97DAB145C9e7CD`
* Address: `0x74995e1075f1b0c308efacc56520d14e4954da6f` (production) and `0x63234d98a126b923a4570f516c064f05b135e00a` (development)

To deploy using the Create3 factory, first ensure you have set up your environment variables:
```bash
# .env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

Then run the deployment script to deploy the CREATE3Factory locked to the generated bytecode, and to get the calldata for the deployment:
```bash
forge script script/Deployer.s.sol \
    --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} \
    --broadcast \
    -vvv \
    --sig "run(address,address,address,bytes32)" \
    <authorized_relayer> \
    <wrapped_native_address> \
    <owner> \
    <salt>
```


> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure to use the correct wrapped native asset address for the chain you are deploying to as this cannot be changed once the contract is deployed.

To verify the contract on Etherscan, run the following command:
```bash
forge verify-contract \
    --chain-id 8453 \
    --num-of-optimizations 200 \
    --watch \
    --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address,address,address)" <authorized_relayer> <wrapped_native_address> <owner>) \
    --etherscan-api-key <etherscan_api_key> \
    --compiler-version v0.8.23 \
    <contract_address> \
    src/FluidkeyEarnModule.sol:FluidkeyEarnModule
```
